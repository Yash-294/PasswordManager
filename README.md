# PasswordManager
This repository contains java files for the Password Manager Application
Password Manager is a small desktop application to store passwords.
It is completely developed using Java only.
The Javafx library is used for development.
In the "PasswordManager.java" file only change the "jdbcConnection" to the "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/passmanager" where passmanager is the name of database in MySQL.
Also, in the same file change the password "root" to the password that you entered while installing MySQL.
Thank you for reading so far.
Hope you like my project.
Cheers!!
